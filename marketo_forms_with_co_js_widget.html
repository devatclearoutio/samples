<!-- 
Marketo form exposes a whenReady callback as part of their SDK. 
This allows us to hook onto the whenReady callback to load the Clearout's JS Widget 
and pass on the form element to the widget's SDK

note: This script can also be used as part of footer code on all pages. which has a marketo form in it.
note: Replace the place holder REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_APP_TOKEN with a 
    client app token generated from clearout dashboard 
-->
